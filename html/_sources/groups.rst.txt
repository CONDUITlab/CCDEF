Core CCDEF Groups
*******************

These are the principal groups in a CCDEF HDF5 file. 
The root group is obviously mandatory but valid files can be created with physiologic data (Numerics and/or Waveforms) only or with clinical data only.

The Research and Reference groups are strictly optional and are not parsed by any of the viewer or analysis tools at this time.

Root (/)
========

The root group is the top level of the file, it contains a series of other high level groups with physiologic and clinical data.

Root Group Metadata
-------------------

The .metadata attribute contains information about the file. ::

    /.meta
        {
            "title": "...",
            "author": "...",
            "organization": "...",
            "time": {
                "origin": "2020-41-17 15:41:22.306880 EST",
                "units": "seconds"
            }
        }

Root Group Datasets
-------------------

.Mapping
^^^^^^^^

One of the key issues in data sharing is the ability to seamlessly ingest data from multiple sites into the end users' application without having to develop site specific pipelines. 
This is complicated by the fact that collect sites will have various local factors that influence the way they store data, based on equipment, etc. 
The data model is self-describing so it is fairly straight forward for end users to locate and extract the data that they need, but to add an additional level of interoperability we provide a mapping table for common key parameters that allow a user to directly (or using library functions) search and access the information they require.

The mapping table describes parameters in terms of LOINC (link) to provide further standardization and clarity as to the nature of the information. 
The mapping table also provides the group, dataset and column (if the dataset is tabular)

+---------+---------------------------+------------+--------+----------+---------+-------------------+
| signal  | dataset                   | local_name | column | category | LOINC   | loinc_name        |
+=========+===========================+============+========+==========+=========+===================+
| HR      | /Numerics/Vitals/         |    HR      |  1     | numerics | 8867-4  | Heart Rate        |

Mapping Table Fields
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:signal:
    The CCDEF standard signal name (see list)

:dataset:
    The dataset containing the signal

:local_name:
    The original name of the signal in the datafile. This will generally be the dataset name if multiple datasets are used or it will be the column name in a tabular dataset.

:column:
    The column number in *dataset* for the signal of interest

:category:
    Waveform or Numeric

:LOINC:
    The LOINC for the signal of interest.
    A number of waveform signals do not currently have assigned LOINC identifiers but additions are being proposed to address this.

:loinc_name: 
    This is the LOINC short name (if it exists) for the signal



** example dataframe from MIMIC **

example from API: f.show_map()

** Standard Signal List **


Future Mapping Possibilities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Future versions of CCDEF may include additional ontologies such as OMOP in the mapping table. 
This is an area of active development. 


Numerics
========

The numerics group contains signals at a sample rate of less than 50 Hz. 
Generally data in this group will be in a single tabular dataset called *Vitals*

Typical parameters include:

- Invasive BP (ABP)
- Non-invasive BP
- SpO2
- HR

Numerics Datasets
-----------------

These can be tabular or single channel as described :ref:`<here>Dataset_details`


Waveforms
==========

The Waveforms group contains data that is recorded at frequencies typically 100-500 Hz.

Waveform Datasets
-----------------

The most common dataset will be hemodynamic measurements conisting of:

- one
- two
- three

Clinical datasets
==================

The clinical group contains a variety of information extracted from the EMR and other sources, generally excluding monitor data.
As there are a wide range of EMR data extraction pipelines, it is difficulty to completely standardize this group but we provide some high level guidance.
Perhaps the greatest challenge within the clinical data is mapping concepts such as interventions and clinical observations. 
This is an active area of research and is one of the goals of the OMOP-CDM.

Datasets
--------
Suggested Clinical Datasets Include:

- Labs
- Micro
- Notes (EMR notes)
- Diagnosis

Imaging if available would be in a separate group */Clinical/Imaging*

Clinical Timestamps
-------------------

Clinical data tend to be much sparser than physiologic data and therefore timestamps will typically be included in these datasets.
The prefered method is a time column with seconds from the orgin or *base_datetime*. 

Clinical Group Metadata
------------------------

Demographics
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Demographic information about the patient is stored as a group attribute ".Demographics" Acceptable demographics fields are:

.. py:data:: age
   :type: float
   :value: the patient's age in years

.. py:data:: sex 
    :type: string
    :value: {M,F}


Thus we have a JSON formatted attribute like this:
. ::

    /Clinical.Demographics
        {
            "Age": 40.1,
            "Sex": "M"
        }


Research
========

The research group is an optional group with no specific format. 
It is intended primarily to support files used in trials and can contain trial specific information such as randomization, group assignment, etc.

References
==========

The reference group is also optional and is included for future development.
The main purpose of this group is to include links (refered to as references in HDF5) to regions of interest within files or external links to other files.
